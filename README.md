# Reforge

Reforge is a simple boilerplate for creating desktop applications that combines React, Vite, and Electron + Electron Forge. With some additionals like TypeScript, TailwindCSS, Prisma, Prettier, Husky, and Lint-Staged. To make this a standalone application, you can use preconfigured PrismaORM to work with SQLite database or you can change it to any other database you want (soon).
